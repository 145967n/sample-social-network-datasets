The nodes csvs contain authors, and the edges csvs contain weighted publication relationships between those authors, which were calculated based on how many times each author appeared with another author in the same journal issue. 

*The networks have been condensed to include only the top connections, such that each author in the network appears in at least two different issues with another author in the network. 

## Background & Significance

### *The Crisis (1910-1922)*

From the Modernist Journals Project's [brief history of *The Crisis*](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=crisiscollection):

>When W. E. B. Du Bois founded The Crisis in 1910, as the house magazine of the fledgling NAACP, he created what is arguably the most widely read and influential periodical about race and social injustice in U.S. history. Written for educated African-American readers, the magazine reached a truly national audience within nine years, when its circulation peaked at about 100,000...

>In the twelve years that will be covered by the MJP edition (from 1910 to 1922), The Crisis also addressed most every facet of life for blacks in America, devoting special issues to such topics as women's suffrage, education, children, labor, homes, vacations, and the war. From the start, the magazine actively promoted the arts as well, and is deservedly recognized as an important crucible for the Harlem Renaissance. Among the notable authors who published in The Crisis during the MJP years is Jessie Fauset—who began contributing in 1912 and became the magazine’s literary editor in 1919—as well as William Stanley Braithwaite, Charles Chesnutt, Countee Cullen, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Angelina W. Grimke, Langston Hughes, Georgia Douglas Johnson, James Weldon Johnson, Alain Locke, Arthur Schomburg, Jean Toomer, and Walter White.

### *Poetry (1912-22) and The Little Review (1914-1922)*

From the Modernist Journals Project's [brief history of *Poetry*](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=1202232622296875):

>To that end [Harriet] Monroe not only published the best modern poetry she could find, but also used the pages of the magazine for debate and discussion about the forms and content of poetry proper for a modern age. She published poems by Ezra Pound, who became her foreign correspondent, and such other poets as Yeats, Eliot, Stevens, Williams, Frost, Sandburg, Masters, Robinson, Lowell, Flint, Aldington, H. D., and many others, introducing new poets to the world and helping to revive an art many people thought had no place in modern culture.

From the Modernist Journals Project's [brief history of *The Little Review*](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=LittleReviewCollection):

>During its first three years, The Little Review was largely an anarchist publication that battled on behalf of imagism and published such writers as Richard Aldington, Sherwood Anderson, Maxwell Bodenheim, Ben Hecht, and Amy Lowell. Under Pound's influence, the magazine experienced a fresh infusion of international experimentalism and added contributions by the likes of Djuna Barnes, T. S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, Mina Loy, Francis Picabia, Dorothy Richardson, May Sinclair, Gertrude Stein, W. C. Williams, and W. B. Yeats. But even among this talented field, The Little Review's most lasting (and boldest) achievement was its serialization of Joyce's Ulysses, in 23 installments, from 1918 to 1920...

### *The Freewoman (1911-1912), The New Freewoman (1913), and The Egoist (1914-1919)*

From the Modernist Journals Project's [brief history of *The Freewoman*](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=LittleReviewCollection):

>Founded by Dora Marsden, with her friend Mary Gawthorpe as reluctant co-editor for the first few months, The Freewoman was a “Weekly Feminist Review” that moved beyond the vote to address issues such as prostitution, homosexuality, and other matters relating to class and gender...With low circulation, The Freewoman struggled economically, and the publisher withdrew before the first year was completed, which ended the life of the magazine.

From the Modernist Journals Project's [brief history of *The New Freewoman*](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=NewFreewomanCollection):

>Making a sharp break from The Freewoman, Dora Marsden's second journal was frankly individualistic and more literary than its predecessor, with Rebecca West operating as literary editor for some months. West brought Ezra Pound and the Imagists into the magazine, with Richard Aldington finally taking over as literary editor...preparing the way for the final shift of the journal's title in the third incarnation of the magazine: The Egoist.

From the Modernist Journals Project's [brief history of *The Egoist*](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=NewFreewomanCollection):

>The Egoist became one of the major magazines of modernism, publishing, as serials, James Joyce's first novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Wyndham Lewis's novel Tarr, along with important poetry and criticism by Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, with Eliot serving ultimately as its Literary Editor...
