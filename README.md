# Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities - Network Analysis - Lab Report #2

This repository contains sample social network datasets for the Washington University in St. Louis graduate seminar **Humanities by the Numbers: Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities**.

Each folder contains a nodes csv and an edges csv that can be imported into Gephi and used for **Lab Report #2**. Each folder also includes background information about the original source of the data, the methodologies used to compile it, and the context/significance of the social network.

The sample network datasets include: [modernist authors who published together in journals](/sample-datasets/modernist_journals_project/); [characters in the Marvel Universe](/sample-datasets/marvel/); [seventeenth-century Quakers](/sample-datasets/quakers/); [books about U.S. politics that were co-purchased around the 2004 presidential election](/sample-datasets/political_books/); and [people in TrumpWorld](/sample-datasetss/trump/). 

If you're not sure how to download the csvs, see this [quick tutorial](/download-tutorial/). For other help, see Gephi's tutorials on [importing spreadsheet data](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Import-CSV-Data), [getting started](https://gephi.org/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-quick_start.pdf), [running force-directed layout algorithms](https://gephi.org/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-layouts.pdf), and [customizing the visualization](https://gephi.org/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-visualization.pdf).
